        <h2>Biography</h2>
        Ying Peng is senior year Bachelor student at <a href="https://www.tongji.edu.cn/">Tongji University</a>, Department of Software Engineering, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8xoKeR0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra"> Prof. Qingjiang Shi</a>, whose reserach field mainly includes signal processing and machine learning.
        <br>
        <br>
        She has taken an Deep Learning Framework Development Intern in Sensetime Group Limited, and the work includes operator development and model training. She is now taking an Coputer Vision Intern in SenseTime, Image Quality Algorithm Department leaded by <a href="http://www.jimmyren.com/">Dr. Sijie Ren</a>. She researches demosaic and super resolution algorithms with collegues at work. She is very interested in computer vision and deep learning, and has been reseaerching in meta learning and attention mechanism. She is devoted to finding solutions to real world problem using machine learning techniques, not only for images, but also speeches and signals. The detailed research contents can be found in her <a href="https://github.com/IsabelleCur/IsabelleCur.github.io/blob/main/Research_Statement_YingPeng.pdf">research statement</a>.
